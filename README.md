## 🚀 Lumos


## Lumos.ai — because apparently, you need Gordon Ramsay to stop roasting your bank account and teach you how to save like an adult.

## 🌐 Live Demo
🔗 **Deployed App:** [https://localhost:3000](https://yourproject.vercel.app)


## 🧠 Overview
Lumos.ai redefines financial literacy for college students through an interactive, gamified learning experience.

It exists to fix a real-world problem — the lack of practical financial education among young adults — by making personal finance fun, goal-oriented, and brutally honest.
Inspired by Gordon Ramsay’s seven-step roadmap, Lumos.ai transforms complex money lessons into bite-sized challenges that users can actually follow.

Unlike generic expense trackers, Lumos.ai doesn’t just record your mistakes — it teaches, challenges, and motivates you to master money management one checkpoint at a time.
